# Deepfake-Detection-Resnet18-Image-Augmentation
Real-Face Detection with ResNet18 and Data Augmentation
This project tackles the challenge of real-face detection using a ResNet18 architecture combined with data augmentation techniques.

## Project Goals

Develop a model capable of distinguishing real faces from synthetically generated faces (deepfakes) or other spoofing attempts.
Employ data augmentation to artificially increase the training dataset size, improving model performance and robustness.
